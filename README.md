This project use `yarn` as the dependency management.

```
yarn install
```

To working with this project locally, you need to transpile typescript into javascript and run the `dist/server.js` with `node`.

```
tsc -w
```

Each time, you make some changes, you need to restart the node process or you can use `nodemon`.
